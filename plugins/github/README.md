GitHub streamlines PR, issue, CI, and publishing workflows for day-to-day engineering delivery.

## What It Can Do
- Inspects repositories, pull requests, issues, and review threads.
- Supports CI triage and fixing failing GitHub Actions checks.
- Provides publishing workflows for commits, branches, and draft PR creation.

## Why Use It
- Keeps code review and delivery workflows in one place.
- Improves turnaround on blocked PRs and failing checks.
- Makes repo-oriented tasks faster for both humans and agents.

## How It Works
1. Use connector-first GitHub workflows for PR/issue/review operations.
2. Fall back to targeted CLI workflows where deeper diagnostics are needed.
3. Apply fixes in your repo and publish through the included PR workflows.

## Quick Examples
- `Inspect PRs, triage issues, debug failing checks, and prepare code changes for review`

## Requirements
- A connected GitHub integration with repository access.
- Optional: `gh` CLI for connector fallback workflows.
